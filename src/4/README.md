# Problem 4

Largest Palindrome Product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Found Golang program to check whether a number is palindrome or not from: https://www.golangprograms.com/go-program-to-check-whether-a-number-is-palindrome-or-not.html . Built off of that. Program is tested against two 2-digit, 3-digit, and 4-digit numbers. Attempted testing against 5-digit numbers, but killed it after it took more than 30 seconds. Clearly it could be better optimized.
